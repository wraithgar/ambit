#date-range-parser

So it turns out I couldn't find anything out there that parsed a date
string in nominally plain English and returned a date range.  This is a
WIP attempt at doing so.  Requires moment, will hopefully eventually be
rewritten to work better with moment, and get a proper package.json and
all that jazz. (Also it needs a better name)
